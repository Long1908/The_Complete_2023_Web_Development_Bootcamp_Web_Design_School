# Typography
Two large families that we need to remember: <b>Serif</b> and <b>Sans-Serif</b>.
We can look typographies of conveying some kind of mood, just as the colors:
1) <b>Serif</b>-Traditional. Bold. Respectable.
2) <b>Sans-Serif</b>-Sensible. Simple. Straightforward.
3) <b>Script</b>-Personal. Creative. Elegant.
4) <b>Display</b>-Friendly. Loud. Amusing.
5) <b>Modern</b>-Stylish. Chic. Smart.
6) etc.

<b>!NOTE</b>: Using lots of fonts can make for a design that is cluttered, overcomplicated and just not very nice.
              Using just a small selection, you can keep your design cleaner, cleared and just much easier to digest.
