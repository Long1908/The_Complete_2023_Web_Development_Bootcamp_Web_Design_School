# Typography
Two large families that we need to remember: <b>Serif</b> and <b>Sans-Serif</b>.
We can look typographies of conveying some kind of mood, just as the colors:
1) <b>Serif</b>-Traditional. Bold. Respectable.
2) <b>Sans-Serif</b>-Sensible. Simple. Straightforward.
3) <b>Script</b>-Personal. Creative. Elegant.
4) <b>Display</b>-Friendly. Loud. Amusing.
5) <b>Modern</b>-Stylish. Chic. Smart.
6) etc.

<b>!NOTE</b>: Using lots of fonts can make for a design that is cluttered, overcomplicated and just not very nice. <br>
              Using just a small selection, you can keep your design cleaner, cleared and just much easier to digest.

# User_Interface
Establishing Hierarchy so that we can pull attention from our customers to most important thing or the thing we want 
the usre to look at. We can do that with:
1) Colors-using poping off and more vivid colors on contrast with the background can pull attention to the user
2) Layout-Block of text shouldn't be too long and tedious or too short and too choppy. Good layout can make the site more easy comprihansable to the user.
3) Allignment-reduce the number/allignments to make the site more professional and clean.
4) Whitespace-Don't make everything tightly cramped together. Space them well and make it clean.
5) Audience-Know who are you targeting and make use of colour, fonts and etc for the the people you are searching to be your client.

# User_Experience
Let the user use your website without complexity and easily.
1) Simplicity: Don't clutter your website with design.
2) Consistency: Functionality of your website should be consistent. Don't change design or how the different elements work.
3) Reading Paterns: THE F PATERN, THE Z PATERN-natural ways the person looks at a webpage
4) All platform design: Need to be good design for all kinds of medias and devices.
5) Dark patterns: DON'T LIE TO THE USER. DON'T MAKE THE PERFORM AN ACTION THEY DDN'T WANT.
